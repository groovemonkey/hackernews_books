# BUG -- comment order is reversed (reflect in title? Or just reverse the array.)
# TODO -- for very large comment sets, we should probably limit PDF size and chunk the data into several files



### Notes:
# http://prawnpdf.org/manual.pdf

# should we just use wickedPDF?
#   - build a massive HTML string from every n responses, and then write to PDF
#   - that might save us the formatting/html headache with prawn
